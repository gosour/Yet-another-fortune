Yet-another-fortune displays random fortune cookies in your terminal
It is easy to add your own cookies, just edit the list file and add your stuff in a new line
If you want automatic startup fo this program add the location of ./bin/main to your .bashrc file
Things to still do
	Make the randomization more effective
	Make seperate subject wise cookies
	ALlow  user subscriptions
	Yet another improvement
This is my first local as well as pushed repo, so there has been a few mistakes, like inclusion of backup files, few extra stuff in ./data
